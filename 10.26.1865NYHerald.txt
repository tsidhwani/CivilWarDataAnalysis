THE ANGLO.R BEL PBIVATEEBS
Wo publish tins morning tbo full text or llic last com
aiunications that havo pussed between the British
Koreign Secretary and our Minister in Loo'lon on the
subject of the ravages of the Anglo rebel pirates
Alabama and Shenandoah. The manner in which the
correspondence has- been brought to light gives it cl
ditional >igniiicance. Instead of its being laid lieforo
Parliament in the ordinary course, a special supplement
of tbe official London GatHU has been indued for the
purpose of laying it before the British public. Earl
It seeil, in his manifesto, has raked together all the
precedents, old and new, which would seem to justify ,
lit* action of the British government. Mr. Adams
meets him with his own weapons, and in
?uveral instinct? above that the precedent* quoted, io?"
stead of favorirc the view taken by the British govern
nient, tell the other way. Earl Ru-^ell acknowledges
that the recognition of the belligerency of the South was
unprecedented. Mr Adams charges, in addition, that it
?was precipitate, nnd shows by the Koieign Focretary's
own words that at the time he acknowledged the South
as belligerents at sea hn hud no otllcial information
that a blockade had been established, but only a state
ment of the probable intentions of the United Ptates
government. Our Minister puts it thut the blockade
might possibly never 1 ave been instituted had
not England's precipitancy in coucoding belligerent
rights to the South left them no other alter
native The conacqnenoea likely to result from
the conduct of the British government towards us, if re
paration is denied and a precedent established, are
forcibly Mated by Mr. Adams. A new era, he say% in
the relations of neutrals to belligerents on the high seas
will open. N' utral ports. In that event, will before
long become the true centre* from which the most of
ffcet.ve and dangerous enterprises against the commerce
of belligerents may be contrived, fitted out and exec ;tcd.
New Florida*, .M aba mas and Shenandoahs will ap]>ear
on overy sea. And he adds, significantly : ? "1 need not.
remind you which of the nations of the world present'*
on every sea around the globe the most tempting prizo*,
in an event no friend would more deplore than tnyaclf,
of Its being again as it has 00 often been hureio.roro,
?loomed to be afflicted by tho calamities of u war. "

The Adttiua-KiiSMoIl Corre?p<tutI?'nce on
Win- Cluims A {{it! nst Eiiglaud.
We spread before our readers to-day (he
official correspondence between Mr. Adams,
our .Minister at London, and Eirl Rns-tell, on'
the subject of the responsibility of England for
property destroyed by the Alabama. Tho cor
respondence iHoIf shows l.lie grounds on wiiioh
Mr. Adams makes tho ilritish government r>
Bponsible, and on which Earl Rassell rekises to
admit responsibility. The question is so plainly
stated that every one will comprehend it. This
being tho oaso, and wo having anticipated the
argument in our iasue of yeslerday, we leave
tho public to pass judgment.
While we have no doubt about the people
sustaining the government in the aclion it
has taken, or about the government
firmly ma ntaining its ground in the dis
pute, we are not without ieur that U
the question be loft to Mr. So ward and
Earl Russell it will dwindle down to one
ot dollars and cen's ? that s-mm * sort of patca
work compromise will be made, leaving the
principle which is involved unsettled. Wo
bopa the President will take hold of the matter
wiib his strong, practical common sense ?n I
sagacious foresight, and havo not only tlie
claim for indemnity settled, but the principle
of international law determined also. The
civil war in this country has brought ou-1 promi
nently before the world questions concerning
the recognition of bjlligeients, what con jti
tutes bjlligereuU and their rights, the law of
blockado, the duties and privileges ol neutrals,
and other cogMato questions. And this w.tr, so
anomalous and unprecedented, has developed
now phases of some of these questions. We
could not say that we shall l.nve properly
closed up the war till they are sealed. Other
nations us well as fhe United .States will be lia
Ule to continual disputes white they are open.
Wo do not know that we arc not even now
on the verge ot a serious difficulty wllh Eng
land, arising from the unsettled and undeter
mined international law on them. It is all
very well to qnotc this great lawyer or lhat
distinguished writer, but tho trouble is both
sides quote, and put their own nnd opposite
constructions upon the authorities they cite,
fherc is no infallible authority nor any well
defined principle laid dowu. 'J uih is what we
need? what the world needs? to settte present
and to nvoid tntnre difficulties. An regards
ourselves especially, while we are not afraid
of war? and no country Is so cnpnblc of
waging it? we desire peace. Wo hnvo a grand
rile and destiny to lulfil in the world, and wo
want a well secured aud lssting pence to pei^
form the mijrhty work. We may bo compelled
o piiH'hitse this lrotn foreign governments by
iho sword, and put the arbi'rntlon of questions
in dispute to nrmed hosts before wo
ran ful secure of permanent peace; but
we would rather do it by other means.
Tha questions alTxtln* us directly at pres
ent, us those referred to abont neutrals,
belligerents and mariUme law, involve princi
ples lhat should oe settled by a Congress of the
great Powers in a clear and well deter
mine I manner, so as to avoid future difficulties.
?Siicli a Congress could at the sniae time settle
the other questions of ? political character
leganl.ng this continent, in which several of
the European Power* are entangled. It would
enable them to escape without trouble and
grncelully, and leave America to the Ameri
cans. W e want no entangling alliances with
Europe, nor do we proposa this by a Congress.
We wish only to ontablUh certain principles,
that peace may be preserved and perpetuated,
with all the blessings of the most friendly
commerce between the New and the Old
Worlds.
Thb Mexican Question.?' The Daily Ntws
of ibla city, which supports the administration
on genernl principle* and opposes its specific
measures, nays that whilo Maximilian in
sweeping the republican element from Mexico
bj proclamations, fire and sword, "onr gov
ernment remains reticent, Inactive, undemon
Htrative, apparently reckleaa of the conne
quencoa of Its apathy." Mr. Secretary Seward,
on the other hand, who la supposed to
know something of the affairs of the.
Department of State, aayn, in reference!
to republicanism in Mexico, u( am ante
that thin important interest baa never been lwt
fright of by the President of the United Stwten
for a single moment, and I expect we shall see
republican institutions wherover they have here
tofore been established throughout the Ameri
can continent speedily vindicated, renewed
and relnvigorated." "Speedily" Is thai word,
and surely Mr. Seward would not use U here
upon a mere presumption, or an n tab to the
whale. We take it that the administration in
tends to vindicate the Monroe Doctrine, and
that Maximilian Is speodily to leave the
. country. Ills rec-nt exterminating prottun cio
mMu do Dit look like It, but tl^y miybe
intended to cover Ma rMMnjt We >ie expect
ing something ''speedily" apcm this subject
from Washington which will [Hit *?i ond to ill

A New Immigration. ? The oiiiiuaf snnouncM- ,
rnent of the War Department that p?r8?M?s who
hare beeu liable to the draft during the war,
and have left the country rather than serve in
the ranks of the national army, may return
without any fear that the pains and penalties
of desertion will be imposed, will undoubtedly
result in an immense immigration from Canada
and Europe. Thousands of young men who
could not afford or were not inclined to pay
the money demanded for substitutes betook
themselves to the other hemisphere or sneaked
off to Canada. They will now return In force,
secured against all liability to answer the
charge of desertion. We tear that Canada will
be almost depopulated by this sudden emigra
tion; for the hegira to that country was some
thing immense during the perilous days when
the draft officials were turning the eventful
wheel which consigned men to the roll of
honor.
Th? Houhk Cijcbk's Position Dejtnkd. ?
By Ibe law pawed at (bo last session of
Congress tlie Clerk of the House, holding over
from the last Congress, on reading the roll ot
members qualified to go into the election of
a Speaker, is restricted to "thosu only who
shall Have been regularly elected under the
laws of Congress or tho several States." It is
now naid, upon radical republican authority,
that Mr. McPherson, the Clerk of the last Cou
gress, upon wuom will devolve the initial
authority, as its presiding ofDcci, in the organi
zation of lh<* new House, has declared that he
1 will not place upon the otllcial lift of members
i any person claiming to be elected from a State
I that has been in rebellion against the govern
ment, inasmuch as lie regards any such per. on
sift not coming within the pale of the aforesaid
law. If such is tho decision of Mr. McPherson,
we know where ho belongs, and that he is tho
radical candidate for a re-election.
The Insurrection in Jamaica. ? We see by
the late news from Jamaica that the negroes
were in insurrection in the eastern pari of
that island, and that a British steamer tilled
with troops was sent there to quell the out
break. Wo imagine that this "insurrection"
will l>o tound to amount simply to a strike for
higher wages. The blacks have nothing to
rebel against except tho oppression ot their
employers. The government which liberated
them, we are bound to assume, does not im
pose upon them oppressive laws against which
they would be forccd to rebel. It is quite pos
sible, however, that the philanthropists who
have obtained the froe labor of Uie negroes for
their own advantage have extended their phi
lanthropy to reducing the prices of labor be
low a point which the blacks are not disposed
to go, and hence tho "insurrection."
Ouk City Pouticlanr. ? The peacemakers
between Tammany and Mozart Ilalls in the
matter of their legislative candidates are get
ting on comfortably. Weed and the Woods
keep quiet The Citizens' Association seems
to be somewhat in a fog; tho republicans are
"inexplicably mixed up," and the result will
doubtless be in November a repetition of the
old story with no material variations. The de
mocrat* have the city, and they will hold it in
November whatever may happen in December.
Yankee Notions vs. Neuuo Suffrage. ? A
Weatern radical organ says that the late vote
of Connecticut "against negro suffrage means
market for clocks, locks, crocks, wooden nut
megs and other Yankee notions, M and that
tho response, from Charleston to New Orleans,
is, "Keep down the niggers and we'll buy your
knick -knacks." We commend this solution of
the question to the Rev. Brother Boecher.
Much Ado Auout Nothing ? The last letter
of Thurlow Weed, in which bo gives the lie to
Luc.ns Robinson. The Old Man ef the Lobby
is getting to be on shocking bad term* with his
old friends, and ho is getting very fussy and
foolish.

seventy delegates were present. The amnesty oath nor

Governor called for a vote by ballot for permanent
I'm*. dent. It was expected that Mr. Charte* J. Jfenkiun,
of Richmond county, would be uuauimoonly nominated ;
but he declined peremptorily, and nominated Hersohei
V. Johnson, of Jefleraon county After discussion It waa .
decided to vote into nooe. Mr Johnsou received all Um ? i
voles cast, with the exception of a law complimentary
oiiim for Mr. Jvnkins

A message was received from Governor Johnson on
.mportaut matters. Hi* announced that all the ottoa
purchased by the Slato had ii>vu captured or burned;
that all assets of tho Stato abroad had been drawn to the
full, that all sources of in> ome are unavaila
ble. and that therefore it Uul become necessary
lor him to provide for tho immediate emergencies Ilt?
invited attention to projiosals for borrowing such money
to the amouut of Mfty thou-wmd dollars, and to the re
district in< of tno 3Ut.ii for tunmliers of lion
^re.-is under the new apportionment. He aUi?
ittcommeiids a cliaug* iu the mod-t of rep*
resentatiou to tho General Assembly. After
some laxval suggestions ho staled the debt
of tho Stato is $20, HIS, 525, of wht>:b only $2,607,750 wa?
contracted before the war. The debt contracted before
tho war, ho said, ia au honorable one, but the other one
is on a very diHerout basis, having uo legal or moral
obligation The Confederate currency and oause tlour
ishe<i together in life, and must be buried iu the san.ji
grave.
The Convention is the iblast assemblage ever convened
in the State, and the prospect is that its action will be
harmonious, conservative and in *11 respects grcufgjng.
