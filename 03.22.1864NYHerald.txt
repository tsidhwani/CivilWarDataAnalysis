The recent WMa from the War Depart
ment, giving General Grant the ehief command
of alt our nnniee. is Mm opening ef the gre*t
campaign of tbe war. The rebellion hoe heen
allowed to live altogether to* long. We must
put it down now If we are erer to put It down.
Should the war drag an for another fear the
rehele will bare a hundredfold hotter chance# of
?ucceea. The duty ef every Northern man ia to
derote himself heartily had Immediately to
aaaiatlng this campaign. From the President
down to tbe meet humble individual In the
land, every one has hia dirty plainly before
him.
General Grant Is the government, so far as
all tbe practical purposes of the war are con
cerned, and he must be unanimously supported.
The watchword of the day is that old war cry
which roused the nation when Fort Sumter
foil:?"Union for the sake of the Union." Let
the President keep his little plana to himself,
and leave General Grant to work out our sal
vation. I-et tbe War Department give General
Grant all the men and means be requires. I<et
the politicians put off President making, and
join ns in securing a country for a President to
govern. Let tbe people furnish tbe volun
teers and Cite money needed, withont any
grumbling^ eomplnluts. Let the TYibvne re
frain from publishing such Incendiary state
ments aa this, which appeared ia Its yester
day's issue:?"Halleck's power ia undiminished;
he is now, as he was months ago, tbe Presi
dent's military adviser, and as such be can, and
probably will, neutralize Grant'* Influence."
Such sneers are iH-timed, and may properly
be callcd "treason In a new form." For
thia lost and supreme effort let us have
the same unanimity, tbe same patriotism,
tbe same unselfish devotion to Union and
Liberty, which marked tbo first uprising of the
North, and added to the history of this country
its most brilliant and most glorious chapter. If
this be done we shall quickly and surely sue
coed. If not. we shall have to bear the blame
of our own defeat.
Tlie abolition parly has never done anything
to (\ssist in putting down the rebellion. The
nino hundred thousand volunteers it promised
have never been seen on their way to the neat
of war. At every crisis, at every danger, the
conservatives have boen called upon to rally to
tbe j.ood old cause, and they have never failed
to respond. They will not fail now. They
will give Grant the same faith, hope, trust and
support that they gave to Scott and to McClel
lan. All that we ask of the abolitionists is to
stand aside and not interfere with tbe work as
they have interfered befoie. We ask them to
hold their tongues about toe nigger, to practise
their miscepenntion schemes in private, to drop
their Presidential wires, asd to get out of the
way of the conservative masses. These are
very little sacrifices in comparison with thoae
which the conservatives have made and are
ready to make, and we hope thut they will not
be refused. We do not appeal to the patriot
ism of the abolitionists; for they have none. We
appeal to a lower, but to them a more in
fluential, motive. Let them look at tbe
rate at riots at the West. Do they understand
what these portend? They portend civil war
at the North; and such a civil war will surely
come if we rush into the mad excitement of a
Presidential election befote tha rebellion is
I practically put down
What would'be tbe results of a Northern civil
war at this time ? Of course it would secure
the success of the rebellion. But. besides that,
it would result in the banging of Greeley, Garri
son, Wendell Phillips, Beecher, George Thomp
son and other such men, without judge or jury.
The Tribute may rant and rave and call us
treasonable~"in a new form''- for saying so;
but we appeal to tbe history of tbe pa3t, and tbe
facts of lloe present, to justify our predictions.
Tbe copperheads are fomenting this civil war
of the future, as tbe abolitionists fomented tbe
civil war now raging. Let Horace Greeley
examine the files of the Trlbuvt. and he will find
there tbo weapon", forged by bis own hand,
which the copperheads are now using against
the government. The curses of tbe Trihunt
fanatics are coming borne to them in tbe cop
perhead conspiracies. We warn these people
now. as we warned them y*ar3 ago. of tjje
inevitable consequences of their suicidal folly.
Again we a-<k them to pause in their headlong
career, and a;ain we show tbem how to retrieve
j their errors, although, al*s! some ol the direful
results of tbo-e errors are now irretrievable.
Let them stop talking t bout Cbnse or Lincoln
1 or anybody else for the n -xt Presidency. Chaae
La* withdrawn. If Lincoln had a particle of
Retire he would also withdraw. Let
Raymond and Greeley save their wrath for
the rebels, cease abusing McClellan?who is a
better man and a better patriot than either of
them?and spook of the Northern conserva
tives respectfully, or not all: for we are in
perilous time . *? hen hasty worde are like
torches In a powdej mag&aine. Above all.
let the President leave Grant alone; let
Staatou supply Giaut with all the material
he m?e<!|: let the politicians turn recruit
ing officer* for Grant?the one who raises
tbe mo*t men to be entitled to tbo high
est place miliar government: let tbe people
give Giant theff unanimous support; let tbe
copperheads keep to their loles, and lot tbe
abolitionWts either fall into the Union ranks or
get down on their knees and beg a merciful
Providence to forgive them their sins against
God and man. and to grant s that success in
tbe present campaign which atone cao restore
the Union and Bare tLe country from aoother
civil war.

Bishop of Nassau, arrived early this monflb in

There Is a portentous eala at this moment,
a lull la our warlike exclteraeat; bat all are
well aware that the stona Is ready U burst,
aad that ere many days the final straggle be
tween the people of the North and their re
bellious brethren of the Soath an oat oom
mence. Grant?the Invincible, unyielding, de
termined Grant?has aow assumed the com
mand-In-chief of our armies, and we all know
that his method Is to move at onoe apoa the
enemy's works. The brave soldiers of the
Army of the Potomac will have aa opportunity
to prove onoe more that when ably com
manded they eaa perform great deeds. Ia the
Southwest General Sherman will burl tbe vete
rans who have kaown no defeat against tbe al
ready disheartened bands of Davis, and at tbe
same time Grant will strike a great, an over
whelming Mow at the very heart of the re
bellloa. He will rid Virginia of the accursed
taint which now pollutes her, drive back tbe
hordes who, during the Imbecile mismanage
ment of Lincoln and Us satellites at Washing
ton, have so many times, with every show of
sucoem, threatened that capital.
At all points will the deluded people of the
South receive ponderous hints to lay aside their
present rebellious course and enter once more
that Union tbey have vainly sought to destroy.
With the return of spring tbe angel of death
shall once more stalk abroad throughout the
South. Not that we of the North wish to crush
our brethren, but because the republic must
live, because treason and anarchy are incom
patible with our great and glorious Institutions,
because, in fact, we are fighting the cause of
civil ization, of progress, of all mankind, and
that with this awful responsibility resting
upon us we must save the Union if we
utterly destroy the traitors who would over
throw it. Tbe teachings of history shall live
again in this present struggle. We shall see
the people of the North gay, prosperous, al
most .unconscious of war. The followers of
Daris will, on tbe contrary, be gloomy and
desolate; they shall know the horrors, tbe
awful Bufferings of civil strife.. They have
raised the storm, and must endure the destruc
tion it entails.
As a contrast to all these gloomy thoughts,
we turn eagerly to the prospect of an equally
determirpd contest, an equally animated but
le<s dangerous campaign, which sba'.l com
mence about the same time as Grant's dread
ful inroad upon Rebeldom. Lieutenant Gene
ral Maretzek, the Commander-in-Chief of all
impresfwrii, whose headquarters are ever
in tbe operatic field, commences next week
a grand spring operatic campaign, which
ha* for its purpose the entire subjugation of
tbis immensely populous city We bear from
good sources that his plana are laid with a view
to tbe utter and complete defeat of bis enemies.
No quarter will be shown or taken?no refer
ence is meant to a coin wbicb once existed in
this country?the entire, unconditional submis
sion of tbe people will alone satisfy Maretzek.
who will come back from Boston merciless and
flushed witb success. He bas to well conducted
his operations against tbat city, in the short
space of one week, that at preseat tbe only sane
person at tbe " Ilub ?' i* Count Joannes. With
so dreadful an example before our eyes of the
prowess of Maretzek. we feel tbat it were vain
for the people to resist his onslaught, and would
counsel a surrender
If this advice is not taken?and we four it
will not be?people are seldom inclined to lis
ten to reason?tbe bavoc made by Mareirck
will be frightful. He will not only use his big
gun?his Swamp Angel "Faust"?to batter down
tbe public defences, bnt will also make a free, we
might say a deadly, use of quite as formidable
operatic weapons which he possesses, and wbicb
are even now. we heur. being put in warlike
trim. He has two able generals, Maz/oleni and
Brignoli. to say nothing of some most desperate
eomroanders who will make bold operatic
raids, giving the public not a moment's respite.
Why, to show the deadly determination of Ma
ret??>k. to prove tbe (orocity which will dis
tinguish tbis spring campaign, it may be men
tioac 1 that be will actually bare a large eorjt*
dc b t'l'l well drilled and at ail times ready to
do fr %'iitful execution, especially among the
susceptible parties in tlie parquet. We have
bca.il of savages who steep their wpapons in
poison. They might take lessons in vindictive
ness from tbis dreadful Maretzek.
On the 28th of March, which shall of cour"*
become a great historical dtte, Maretzek fiivs
off his first gun. That evening will be a marked
one for New York. Tb* public will have to
encounter nut only this danger, but also the
opening of tbe Sanitary l air, tbe anaa.il ball
of the Melo Cboreans and tbe production of
several new pieces at our most pop dor
theatre*. We can all imagine what bavoe tbe
Fair will cieate. The MHo-Cboreaas will, it is
said, be visited at Irving Halt by the (b*pt
Diplomatique Th* President. If be cannot
come, will be reprinted by b!s latest joke.
Secretary Welles will arrive at midnight In tbe
yawl of tbe Alabama. It is asserted tbat on
this occasion be will be awake. Wo are incltaed
lo doubt tbis statement, although It cornea
through the best source*. Secretary Chase, if
bo cannot find a moment to spars from his
Presidential wirepulling, will send bis weight
In greenbacks. It Is expected tbat vast crowds
will await tbe arrival, or rather the non
arrival, of Chase with intonse anxiety. Greeley
or aome leadiag African will represent the
Trihuue; and, last, aad not least, the celebri
ties In art will grace with their presence this
ball. Opera, Fair and dancing will render the
night of Easter Monday attractive for the vo
taries of pleasure, taaki it a fitting commence
ment of the spring campaign, and prove tbe
claim of New York to Wing tho gay and bril
liant metropolis of tht New Wortd.

PqHjAI>blfhijl Piuos Poutioiak ? The Phila
delphia Ay?, aa uamitigated oopperbead organ,
appear* to knew all tha plana of General
Grant In reference to the oemlnf Richmond
oaoipalffl, all the plans of tha enemy, all the
facta regarding the strength of the two armlet
a month or two henoe, and all the movements
and results that are to follow. ~
Thua we are told that by April General Grant
will have an army ia Virginia ameuntiag, all
told, to oae hundred thousand white soldiers
and fiftoea thousand negroes; that by that time
General Lee will bare aa available faree not
less than one hundred thousand strong; that
General Grant will divide bis army into two
eolumns, ana af which will more up the penin
sula aad the other from the Rapldan?" Grant
being famous for dividing his armies into dif
ferent oelumns, eaeh directed against the same
object;" that "he can scarcely begin bis ad
vance before tha middle of April, as the equi
noctial storm has yet to come;" that "if be has
already made his plans he may depend that
tha Confederates know them;" that he will have
obstacles to enoounter "fhr more formidable
thaa ever opposed him in the West;" that "the
siege of Richmond is oot the siege ofVicks
burg;" that "Lee is not Pemberton," and that
"the War Office at Washington is far too close
for comfort."
From these estimates and opinions the reader
is left to draw his own conclusions; and we
cannot perceive how, from such premises, be
can arrive at any other conclusion than a disas
trous failure to General Grant. We, however,
look for better thing*. Lee cannot very well
increase his Virginia army to one hundred
thousand men without seriously weakening Joe
Johnston in Georgia and uncovering North Car
olina; and should he do so General Grant may
strike first In North Carollnn or Georgia; for
it must be remembered that in support of his
movements against Richmond he can bring all
the armies of the Union into play. Richmond
may bo taken through North Carolina, or by
way of Atlauta in Georgia, or even by way of
East Tennessee; and should Lee leave either of
these doors open to strengthen himself in front
of Richmond Grant will be apt to find it out
and act accordingly. Nor have we any serious
apprehension that the War Office or the Wash
ington Directory will be allowed by General
Grant to interfere with his plans and combina
tions. Doubtless he has accepted his new posi
tion with the distinct understanding that he is
to be guided bv his own judgment in managing
the grand campaign upon whiob he is about to
enter; and believing that, ns at Vicksburg, he
will follow his own counsels, wn anticipate the
most glorious results.

prepared to accept titles of nobility from Maxi

And now. we suppose, we shall bare immedi
ately a long and brilliant array of notable*
selected for the Mexican market from the
cream of rebel society, and bearing all sorts of
titles. Look out for his Royal Highness Jeffer

Though the fate ?f Pie bill is thus still in

back at vn Otbkr Ewa.?It is well under
stood that General Sherman's expedition for
Bel on* and Mobile failed because of tbo failure
of Generals Smith and Grierson to join bim
from the north; but it now appears thai there
was a drawback at ths other end. Aooordlng to
the Mobile papers, had General Banks, with ?
respectable force, oo-operated with Admiral
Farragut, the oity would hare been in groat
danger, and might hare been captured; but
General Basks was, unfortunately, preoccupied
in the business of tbo political reorganisation
of Louisiana, according to tbo last December
proclamation of President Llnoolo. That busi
ness being regarded at Washington as mora
Important than Mobile, Admiral Farragut was
sent forward simply to amuse the enemj (a
that quarter and to divert hie attention from
Sherman. Now, however, as Louisiana has
been put in an ncc?j>iable shape for tbo
Baltimore Convention, ii is to be hoped
that General Banks wiil be allowed to
proceed to the practical business of the war, ,
and that the prosecution of this political work
of reergnnitattenfOr Presidential purposes wilt
be postponed to a more conren^nt season.
