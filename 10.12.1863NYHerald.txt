There is nothing new front Gen. Rosecrana'army
Inter than that ulre;.?ly pnblibhed. Our correspondents
furntali some interesting details of the
proceedings of the amy, but there art no uew
movements of importance to report.
From General Meade's army we learn that the
enemy Juvo beon concontr.vtiuir a heavy force
around Madison Court House, n' that on Friday
n;g!tt and Saturday morning they moved
oul of town in a northwardly direction.
A division of infantry, a large body of
ottvalry and considerable artillery were occasion
ullj- beeu by our signal wen through openings in
tlic forcsf, which generally conccal the road. The
object of tlio uiovoment could not at that time be
determined. lL appears that one of General KilPatrick's
cttvaliy brigades attempted a reconnoisaance
on the south side of Robertson's river, when
they were met by a large body of Stuart's
rebel cavalry. A fight ensued, continuing an hour,
when our troops fell back npon the infantry reteivee.
After auother severe contest the influitry
were compelled to give way, and a considerable
number of them were captured. A detachment of
onr cavalry then dashed upon the enemy, retaking
nearly all the prisoners. Onr entire force was
then pushed back toward Culpepper, skirmishing
on the way and contesting every
foot of ground. Heavy firing In the afternoon
Indicated that the contest had been renewed.
Onr signal station on the top of Thoroughfare
Mountain was nearly out off, but the entire party,
with their property, escaped. This shows that
there must have been some hot work in this dileotloii.
There is ^othing later from Charleston.
We publish this morning a carefully prepared
map of the republic of Mexico, showing
the whole extent of the national territory
and the infinitesimal part thereof now merely
touchcd by the French. Nothing can possibly
more clearly show the emptiness of the French
claigi that they have conquered the country. The
truth Is that they only hold a military line, and a
very dangerous one, from Vera Ccaa to the city of
Mexico. It is alio important to know that other
difficulties are threatening the French. They
have come to an opon rupture with the church party?the
only one that baa ever supported them?
and jane of the regenta?Ormaeabea, Bishop of
TolCMingo?has consequently resigned. lu the
meantime Juaren 1s every day growing stronger.

Alien, "mivnds me of the Devil's promising to
give our Saviour the whole world, wlon real'y
the confounded rascal didn't own a foot of it."
In order to make thin matter perfectly clear,
we publish this morning a map ol Mex co, upon
which the territory he'd by the French in distinctly
marked by heavy black lines. By
reference to this map it will bo seen
that the French possessions in Mexico consist of
a parallelogram, extending back from the coast
at Vora Cruz, and including the Mexican capital
and three smal 1 rhomboids?on? at Campcachy,
ono at Tehuantepec and one at Tampico harbor.
The.-o possessions sink into iuuignidcance
when compared with the vast extent of the
Mexican republio, to which, indeed, they boar
about the same relation as Governor's Island
to tho Stato of New York, or Napoleon the
Third to Napoleon, tho Great. When the United
States conquered Mexico we held the entire
eastern coast, the line of the Rio Grande on the
north, California and the soaeoast on the wet,
besides the Moxican capital, all the fortiflod
cities, and a large extent of country In the interior.
In point of fact, however, the throne
which Napoleon la so anxious for Maximilian
to occupy does not rest upon Mexican soil al
all, but upon tho bayonets of French soldiers,
and as noon as these invaders are driven out
the throne and It# occupant will tumble to the
ground together. Within three months after
the olose of our civil war this consummation,
so devoutiy to be wished, will be achieved by
our powerful, veteran armies.
The fact upon which the French journals and
the French Emperor lay mogt stress is that the
French troops hold tho Mexican capital, and
therefore control the whole country. This is
a European idoa, not recognized either in
I theory or practice on this side the Atlantic. In
Europe it is accepted as an axiom that Paris is
France, that London is England, and that Vienna
is Austria. On this continent, however,
Washington is nob the United States, as the
British discovered when they enptured that
city of magnificent distances and small poli,
ticlans in 1813. If we should have a war with
England, and should take possession of Victoria
CKy. we should not congratulate ourselves
upon having seized Canada by that singlo
blow. The case 1b the aaaae with
Mexico. Napoleon la master of the capi<
tal, but not of the eountry. The Maidcan
people are still republicans, and
will not submit to a foreign emperor. The
knowledge that they hare brought their present
troubles upon themselves, and the mutual animosities
and jealousies of their leaden, have
thus far crippled their efforts; but they are now
organizing for the struggle for independence,
and we c^n assure Napoleon that the hardest
fighting of his Mexican campaign is yet to come,
and that his complacent conviction that the
affair is now accomplished is a gross error.
Beyond this faet, however, Is a still more serious
contingency. If the Mexican republicans
do not drive away tho French, the American
republicans certainly will. Our Monroe doctrine
has been violated, and must be re-established.
Instead of offering distant thrones to
other poople, Napoleon had much better devote
his attention to the work of more firmly
securing his own seat upon the throne of
France. Nothing is gained whore too much is
attempted.
Battle Plfc?t, Ancient and Modern.
We hare been much amused at the funs

of Chattanooga furnished by the war correspondent
of the HeiuLO?especially by tho
jubber of the whiskey-soaked Louisville Journal,
anu vy in? pmiun aim iury 01 me conieinpuuiv

hido their own deficiencies?eodesvoring to depreciate
our account of the buttle because they
had none of their own?the** worthless sheets
have gouo too far. nn I haro reached that point
where the whole effect of such attempt* "falls
? on the other side." Kvery mention they make
of tLn matter cattt? attention more strongly to
the fuels of the caso, which are all to our
crodlt tnd to their disgrac; ami In their denunciations
of our account?which is a denunciation
of our success?they utter our praise.
There were but two correspondents on the
tield of battle at Chattanooga?one tbe correspondent
of the Cincinnati 0 utUt, and tlie
other Mr. Sh%nks, of this paper. Accounts
from other newspaper correspondents than
these two gentlemen are not worth the paper
they arc written on; but other account* hare
beeh written in plenty. Petty establishments,
not able to keep correspondents in tbe field,
hurry away their itemixera to tbe roar' ol
an army whenever a battle la imminent.

battlein this wtr, and aalho beataccouut written
of any buttle ever fought. We do not in
this statement go o syllable too far. In Jhis description
of the great struggle at Chattanooga
Mr. Shanks 1ms done what has never before been
done since men met one another In battle. He
baa furnished to tho world, directly from the
bfittlo field, an aocount of an immense action
that is us intelligible and as clear as the caltn
statements of Jomini, and that thrill* un' and
down one's nerves as Sir Philip Sidney said tho
ballad of "Chevy Chaee" did?"like the blast
of a I rum pot." When and by whom has this
been done before T
Begin wi?h the Scriptural account of the
"buttle of four kings against five," and come
down to tho great battle^ of modem times, aud
you will find that It bos not boon done at all.
Thvmbr^a is the first general action in hMory of
which we hivo any particular acoount. It was
fought by over four hundred thousand men on
one side end nearly twe hundred thousand on
the other, and deoided the possession of all
Asia. Every account of it, however, is miserably
poor by comparison with the account we
gavo our renders of the lite great battle In
Georgia. At Marathon tho Greeks fought the
rorsians, as Herodotus says, " in a manner
worthy to be recorded," and Herodotus accordingly
records It. Marathon is one of the world's
great battles, and Herodotus is the father of
history, and of course we have an immense
rAdrtAnf fnr Knth* Imf irn it. nut T\rnnnnn#A niir

than the Qalicarnassian on battle piocos.
Plutarch has tried bis hand 09 battles to a
great extent Compared with our accoupt hi
question, his description of the way in w|riph
; Alexander ''opened the gates of Asia'* on the
i banks of the Granicos roads like a puerilo aneodoto.
Nor is the account of Arbela any better.
All accounts of Alexander's battles may be road
in vain to find a first rate one. 80 may all the descriptions
of the battles fought by the race of
generals who contended for the kingdoms ho
left. If the genius of Alexander found no lit
chronicler, Pjrrhus could not expect it. How
comparatively tame to nntiqttUy vpom Tber
mopyto, Plattea, Leuctra and Maatinea. And
the lesson is sufficiently simple?the historians
did not see the battles of which tbey wrote, and
In some instances did not write their accounts
of the battles until hundreds of years after they
had been fought. Heneo they Inevitably want
clearness and life.
Tbere Is In Grecian literature one celebrated
description of a battle written by a man who
was present on the field at*a looker-on, and
therefore not too muoh engaged to see the
whole battle. This Is the description in Xunophon
of the battle of Cunaxa, between Ovrus
and the "Great King," from which field the
"ten thou?and" began their celebrated retreat.
As the account of a spectator, it is a fair ancient
parallel with our account of which we
speak. Let any one compare tho two and see
how Xenophon limps. Jnsephu* is another instance
of a writer who was present at the battics
he describe*. All the fights about Jerusalem
In tho great siege by Titus arc given in
his pages with a certain reality and life; but
they are altogether deficient in br> adth and
force.
Neither havo the battles of tho great Roman
wars any especial vividness in Roman historv.
Aim that then? was no special correspondent
with that wonderful soldier, Hannibal, through
nil tbs year* Ibat bo remained io Italy. Ax it la,
we have no adequate account of tbe dreadful
ambuscade at Thraaymenus, carried on while
"an earthquake rolled unbeededly away,'' nor
any account of Cnnnn1 worthy of it, nor ol Zama.

Kti'vInU by John IS nil.
Tito loiter wbicli we nubiuit to our reader*
lliitt morning from the Richmond fpocial correst.nnjlAlil
r.f l+>f TiAlt^AII TWilJiC r?f Atlirllut 90 Ml
the movomenta and prospoota of tho rebel
armies, the blockade, and tbe general condition
of tha rebellion, will be found sufficiently imuitinz
bv Ho intelligent reader to repay an
attentive rerusal. John Hull in Richmond is
Htuffiwl with such information as bis rebel
friends think fit to give him; and in bebalf of
their cause be faithfully fulfils bis mission of
stuffing sympathizing John Bull in England.
The loiter iu question, to be sure, is a heavy
draft upon English orcdulity; but the writer,
he it remembered, is in Richmond and in tho
service of tbe London Times.
Passing over his items of information, his
arguments and hi* conjectures concerning the
movements and efficiency of the rebel armies,
East and West, let us briefly examine some of
tbe most conspicuous of the numerous impudent
fictions with which this letter abounds.
He says, for example, that never since tbe
beginning of this war "were the spirit and
temper of Southern resistance more keen and
exasperated than at this moment.'" lie hi
speaking, however, only for the oabal at Richmond,
and be finds it convenient to shut his oyep
to tbe peacp and Union meetings going on in
North Carolina, and to the fact that in Arkansas,,
llisfj'ssippi and Northern Alabama the work of
recruiting tor tbe rebel arrov is extensively
pursued by means of bloodhounds. He says
next that "no one is now ignorant tbat during
tbe first six or eight mouths of the conflict there
was not enough gunpowder at any of the
Southern ports to have supplied tho demands
of ft single battery for three hours." On the
contrary, we know that there was sufficient
gunpowder in the magazines of the Norfolk
Navy Yard seized by the rebels to supply all
the batteries and Hold works of the rebellion
for a whole year, to say nothing of the supplies
seized with Fort Macon, Fort Sumter, Fort
1'ulaaki, and numerous other forte and military
find naval depots, from Virginia to Terns.
We are also assured by this veracious John
Dull In Richmond that this year throughout
the Davis confederacy " the abundance of cereals
is such lhat it would supply the whole
population for three years to come.'7 Against
this brazea-raead assertion the bread riots which
bave occurred within the last few months at
Richmond, at Atlanta and Rome, Ga., and at
Mobile, will afford a deefeive answer. But we
have before us the maximum prices of provisions
established by the rebel government at
liiotuaoad, as reported In the Jtoamimr at that
city, October 2. lb the oAoiel schedule the
maximum prices of cereal* are thw set downsWheat,
fivo dollars per bushel; Hour, (Vein
twenty-two to twenty-eight dollars per barrel;
corn (Indian), font- dollars per bushel; rye. three
dollars and twenty cents per bushel; oats, two
dollars per bushel, and rice, twenty oents per
pouud. Thews are the maximum prioes decreed
by tho rebel government; but they are the minimum
prioes at which the articles enumerated
are sold, and only at these prices on public account.
Private sales rule at higher figures, to
the extent of fifty, seventy-Ire, and even one
hundred per cent.
Tbo next thing which in this Richmond letter
challenges our special attention is an "appeal*'
from a Churlustou merchant, exhibiting
the inefficiency of the blockade aud denouncing
the injustice of England in continuing to respect
it. In this exhibit it is shown that during tho
present year there hare been forty-three arrivals
of blockade runners at Charleston and
forty-nine at Wilmington, and the names
- t I'i.li.inl ^ ,.tnAn D..1 tnLlaa it..
OI i>u? *?wno ?ftv ^iruii. axil, i?wid| tut
case of Cbarlctstoriv we find that these fbrtytbree
arrivals tiro limited to Rome twenty vesseln,
and that more than half of these havo town
captured or destroyed, lncladlag the llerald,
the Flora, the Ruby, the Margaret and Jessie,
the Antonlca and tin; Eagle. Numerous other
vessels engaged in the *ame contraband trafEr,
and not included in tbla Charleston list of fortythree,
huvc sufTered the same fate in endeavoring
to get in or out of that port?among them the
fine and fast going steuuier Princess Royal, captured
Inst February, bound in, and valued,
ship aud cargo, in Philadelphia, at over n million
of dollars.
liut this zealous John Hull In Richmond, in
regard to these Charleston blockade runners,
effectually answers himself; for while in the
bodj- of Ills loiter be says that their trade at that
port amounts to ?ighteen millions of dollar* a
your, he admits in bis postscript that, with the
Union occupation of the whole ?f Morrle
Island, Charleston Is completely shut up. The
"niuiimum prices'' established at Richmond on
imported goods by the rebel government prove
conclusively that the blockade along the whole
roast is indeed a stringent one in spite of the
inefficiency of old Mr. Welles, and is a sore
thorn In the side of the ' confederacy;" for
otherwise it would not be decreed that dealers
hall oharge no higher price at Richmond than
three dollar* per pound for coffee, ten dollars
per pound Tor tea, army shoo* ten dollar* per |
< pair, woollen sock* one dollar and a qaartar per
pair, ahoethread two dollars per poand, and so !
on ta the end of tb? chapter. The high prices
f cotton la Knglaud and the uoaxampled

vie*.
Modern timon have oooe seen Europe completely
ehukttu ?>y a great continental war. In
the previous biwtory of the human race there la
no parallel to lb? magnitude of the atrugglea
\vh^<1 by and ngalnat tbe First Napoleon. lie
won mo proHi HOiaivr or we age. bucu men
appear onoe in two or three centuries. He
CHUriod I lie past to be forgotten, and effected so
luauy changes that be may alipoat be said to
have invented war. Hie campaigns are the
masterpieces oi strategic art, aud they who aspire
to irucoesflaAsetdiers carry hie single battles
in their racmorieb aa painters carry tfee figures
and faces limned by Raphael. His example is
tho court of iMt retort in all questions on war.
Against this great soldier or In his cause every
State in Europe was oompelled to strike, and
the whole continent, and the very limit of its
resources for war, were, as a consequence, ,
brought out. '
In our own times and on our own side of the
Atlantic we ace now a remarkable parallel to
the wars that devastated Europe lu the twentytwo
years that begin with Toulon and end with
Waterloo. Between these great straggles?the
one in Europe and the other in America?
there are many similarities. Both are conti
oeutal. Both continents are divided into numerous
political communities or States that
differ one from another in many respects. On
our side of the water the people of these va
rlous States had an apparent common bond of
unity in their language; bnt this did not prevent
the growth of a hatred as deep and bitter
as any that crer existed between the kindred
European nations of Great Britain and Franoe.
Every one of the European States was represented
by its quota In the great wars, and
ovory one of our States Is similarly represented
in the great straggle now in progress.
Look at the twenty-two years of Europe and
at the less than throe years of America, and
what is the comparison of power that the two
continent? have shown? Russia had in the field
at on* time In * those great wars, for
a great battle on her own territory,
one hundred and thirty-two thousand men.
New York Slato alone has sent over two hundred
thousand men to the field up to the present
timo. All the allied States, in tho largest
army they ever brought together, could muster
but two hundred and eighty thousand men.
New York and Illinois would more than equal
this, while New York and Pennsylvania would
outnumber it by over a hundred thousand men.
Ordinary battles in Europe were fought by
thirty and forty thousand men; and it was
esteemed a tremendous army of power when
armies of one hundred thousand or ono hundred
and fifty thousand confronted one another; bnt
we on one aide alone have over half a million
men under arms, and, in addition to numerous
smaller forces, keep in the field three armies
whose numbers range from one hundred thousand
to one hundred and fifty thousand men.
On tho peoiasula the Army of the Potomac
numbered one hundred and fifty thousand; and
at the battle or titottpsfrncf, when it was
smaller than It had ever before been, it had fbr
duty seventy thousand men on tho second day.
When Napoleon, in tho series of battles at Loipb'c,
loet sixty thousand men in killed, wounded
aud prisoners, Europe hud put hiu down.
Though that sixty thousaud was from an army
off one hundred and sixty thousand, lie was
overthrown by the loss. But in the past summer
the successes of our Northern armies deprived
the rebels in one week of ever ninety
thousand men. and they are not ruiaed yet.
Napoleon claimed six victories in hi? firct
campaign in Italy, ond claimed t? have killed
and wounded tea thousand of the enemy. Six
victories on either ride would be very cheaply
purchased in our war si that, price. Bull rua
quit* equal.* that average iu csrnsgc; and that.
It has be?'n said, was not a bottle at all. At
Eckmuhl, out of seveuty-fivc thousand, Napo
i<?ol iosr. rour luouaaua in tuttea una wounu'-a. !
With about the ?;vm<' number or le-> engaged
at Gettysburg and Chattanooga, our Ion wa? '
at !?ac>t. four times that. Such if the difl'eivncr>
in Spirit and tenacity bntwoen men oo two
sides of ib? ocean At Waterloo Blncber an ) 1
Wellington bad together two hundred anJ
fifty thousand, and Napoleon one hundred
nnd twenty thousand Lueu. The French lost in
killed, wounded and prisoners thirty thousand,
and the Allies In killod and wounded only
seventeen thousand. Such wa? the great day
of Waterloo, theft changed the fate of Europe.
At the battle of Antietam the rel?el loss In
killed, wounded and prisoners was about tb?
same as that of Napoleon at Waterloo, and our
low in killed and wounded wax probably about
two thousand lee? than that of the Allies.
But the total number of men at AnUetam on
both Bid*'* was at the verv leant one hundred
and fti'tjr thousand lew than Nitpoleon, Wellington
and Blncher altogether had Moodiest
day that Europe ever saw.''
From Mich number* it may be ?e*-n that our
contlneutal war. In njugnltudo* and in the desperate
character of ita battles, 4w?rft that of
Europe untlrely.

la Mother pert of to day's paper there will
be found a most Interesting and ominous eor<
reepondenoe between tbe acting British Consul
at Savannah, Georgia, and the obstreperous
Governor Jlrowu, who now lord* it over tit#
unfortunate people of that State, who, for tbe
time being, asp committed to hi* rule. Tbe
whole question Jurus upon the right of tbs
bogus gorewraenApf the rebel* to seise up*a

by an arbitrary proce* of uueqttui c>nser*ption
to force Uvm, though foretamrs aud
aliens, to fight for a caubo in wbfch Ifcty are In
no way Interested.
The acting British Goneul, Mr. FuHnrtoo,
has tbkrn rory strong and dec'sl?e groo?4
in the premises. He dates his communiontlons
from the " British Consulate" at Savha.

authority to aot for the British govornOMtafc
to Mr. Benjamin, the rebel Secretary ot Bute,
who approved It. The object of bltt despatobee
to Governor .Brown, of Qeergia, i# to proteil 4
against Uie enrolment of subjects of Greol *
Britain as ttoldlor* in the rebel rank#, _ ,
and adds that an/ residents of Georgia otahning
to be British subjects who may be drafted*
If required to leave their immediate homes er
to meet the United State* foroea In actual conflict,
shall throw down their arms. Mr. FnUarton
very wisely regards the rebellion
State of Georgia, among the otbe?
Stales, as In open rebellion against
Its legitimate government; and further
he refuses to view the 8tato as anything els*
than a portion of the old Union, engaged In e
civil war with her fellow citizens of othsc
States.
The Governor th?t/i steps in and says thai
ho only desires the British residents of Geer- ?
g!a to defend the State in case of raids of
tbo Yankees that might affect slave propertf,
women and children; and he adroitly argues
that if they remain in the State and eojoy its
protection they must aid and protect it in re> <
tarn. Mr. Fullarton immediately crashes this
Governor by deolaring that aliens ean take no
part in a civil war without the coasont of theb <own
government, and finishes his conclusive
argument with these serious and expressive '
official words:?"The despatches which I hare
received fro? the British government relative It
compulsory service are strong. I am directed
to remonstrate in tie strongest terms against
all attempts to foroe British subjects to take up
arms. Should these remonstrances fail, 'the
governments in Europe Interested in this qneetion
will unite in making such representations . '

The reply of Governor Brown la characterised k
by groat obstinacy. He refuses to enter j
into any discussion to prove that Northern '
soldier* in Georgia are part of a hostile
Pow*. foreign to that State, and coolly ln?
forms the British Consul that if bis put*
sion that the United States goversmeAt It
still the government of Georgia be oorree^
then bis appeal for the protection of British
subjects must be made direct to the Unto*
government at Washington. The Govwrno*
concludes by ineisting upon tie right of qjji
rebels to the service# ef British snbjeott
or other foreigners in the Stele, ud thrsMs? y
that if, when drafted, they shad throw down
their arms, m suggested l>y Mr. Fnilartea and "
Mb government, they shall be dealt with "Hi
as much severity ss if they were born citinsfi
cfGeorgia. The British Oensul immsMntslf
responds by demanding the release of J. V. ant
F. M. BWy, two British subjects, whohad htm
drafted aod forced into the Southern wrvlta
The Governor's reply is very evssive end to
no way satirfactory. And thus the antta* !
stands.
It is evident that this sating British Gesnl \
n a fhr more sensible and prndent man thna
many of bis compeers in other parte of thn
Union. This is not the first time that the rebels
have laid rough ud violent bands upon Brfttab
subjects, while in the North they are not only
exempt from conscription, but from %ll kinds of
oppression. The only yfifjot England to b? I
